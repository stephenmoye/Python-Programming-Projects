# Magic Dates
# The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written in the following format, the month
# times the day equals the year:
# 6/10/60
# Design a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit
# year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day equals the year. If
# so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise, it should display a message
# saying the date is not magic.
