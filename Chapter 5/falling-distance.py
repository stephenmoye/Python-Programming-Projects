# 13. Falling Distance
# When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the
# distance the object falls in a specific time period:
# d=12gt2
# The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the
# amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
# Write a function named falling_distance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as
# an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during
# that time interval. Write a program that calls the function in a loop that passes the values 1
# through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.
