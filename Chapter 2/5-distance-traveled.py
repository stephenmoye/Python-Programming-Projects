# Distance Traveled
# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can
# be calculated with the following formula:
# Distance=SpeedÃ—Time
# A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
# The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
# The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
# The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

SPEED = 70
TIME1 = 6
TIME2 = 10
TIME3 = 15

print("The car will travel", SPEED * TIME1, "miles in", TIME1, "hours")
print("The car will travel", SPEED * TIME2, "miles in", TIME2, "hours")
print("The car will travel", SPEED * TIME3, "miles in", TIME3, "hours")
