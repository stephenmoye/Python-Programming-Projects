# Distance Traveled
# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can
# be calculated with the following formula:
# Distance=SpeedÃ—Time
# A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
# The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
# The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
# The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

speed = 70
time1 = 6
time2 = 10
time3 = 15

print("The car will travel", speed * time1, "miles in", time1, "hours")
print("The car will travel", speed * time2, "miles in", time2, "hours")
print("The car will travel", speed * time3, "miles in", time3, "hours")
